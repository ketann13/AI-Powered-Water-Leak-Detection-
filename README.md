## 🚀 Features
- Predicts **leak status** based on **pressure, flow rate, and temperature**.  
- Multiple ML algorithms implemented:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Performance comparison to select the **best model**.  
- Interactive **dashboard with gauges & charts** (Chart.js, Gauge.js).  
- **Flask backend** with REST API for predictions.  
- User-friendly **web interface** for real-time data input & visualization.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Flask  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Joblib  
- **Frontend Tools:** Chart.js, Gauge.js

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing & cleaning  
2. Feature scaling (StandardScaler)  
3. Model training & evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, reports)  
4. Flask API integration  
5. Interactive dashboard for predictions  
6. Hosted live on Render.com for real-time use
